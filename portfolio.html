    <section id="about">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I was born on February 15, 2005, at the Mirugi Kariuki Sub Hospital in Nakuru County. My family welcomed me with joy, believing I would become a leader. My father, John Gitau, was a lecturer and director of a youth and women self-help program, while my mother, Virginia Wambui Gitau, was a talented chef and fashion designer. As the youngest and only boy in a family of four, I was nurtured in a supportive environment that fostered my ambitions.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <h3>Primary School</h3>
        <p>I attended Victory Primary School before transferring to Mburu Gishua Primary School due to financial constraints. Despite challenges, I aspired to become an engineer. I became popular for entertaining my peers with rap and gengetone songs, but later focused on my studies and became involved as a youth pastor at PCEA Emmaus Church.</p>

        <h3>High School</h3>
        <p>In 2019, I joined Nairobi Road High School, where I was elected as the CU chairman, known as Pastor Jeymo. I organized fundraising events for local children's homes and became a beloved figure among students, completing my high school education in 2022.</p>

        <h3>University</h3>
        <p>After high school, I took over my father's land, cultivated crops, and learned skills in welding and CCTV installation. In 2023, I enrolled at the Kenya Institute of Software Engineering and Professional Studies in Thika, pursuing software engineering and robotics. I started a business selling ice pops, earning the nickname "Jeymo the Tycoon."</p>
