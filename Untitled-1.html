        <p>I was born on February 15, 2005, at the Mirugi Kariuki Sub Hospital in Nakuru County. My family welcomed me with joy, believing I would become a leader. My father, John Gitau, was a lecturer and director of a youth and women self-help program, while my mother, Virginia Wambui Gitau, was a talented chef and fashion designer. As the youngest and only boy in a family of four, I was nurtured in a supportive environment that fostered my ambitions.</p>
